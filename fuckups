I made the Vec3 generic type define its variables with type T instead of *T, so now I have to reinitialize a new struct every time I do an operation.
I'm too dumb to make *T work. Just sticking with T.
Using too small a screen throws errors in computing pixel coords? Kinda makes sense. But what the fuck man
I'm a dumbass. Turns out, that happened because points out of screen bounds gave negative coordinates (obviously), but I casted to unsigned ints.
Implemented a function which takes params in a set order. Then I proceeded to ignore that order and switch params.
Accidentally included a bajillion line long file in git commit.
